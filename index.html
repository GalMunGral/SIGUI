  <h1>
    Structure and Interpretation<br />
    of Graphical User Interfaces <br />
  </h1>
  <h3 style="color: gray">What I Wish I Had Learned in CS 101</h3>

  <p>
    How exactly does a computer
    <em>compute</em> a vector-based graphical user interface into existence? How
    do vivid visual metaphors arise algorithmically from the first principles of
    logic and arithmetic? This (incomplete) article is my first attempt at a
    coherent answer to these questions in a way as concise as possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Event Loop</h2>

  <p>The interactivity of GUIs comes from its event loop:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
while !quit
  if event = poll(): handle(event) # input
  if dirty: draw()                 # output
</pre
    >
  </blockquote>
  In each iteration, the program processes inputs and generates outputs:
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
fn handle(event):
  target = pick(event.xy)      # <-- input, state
  target.handle(event)         # --> state

fn draw():
  for each geometry on screen: # <-- state
    draw(geometry)             # --> output, state
</pre
    >
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    These two steps are are interconnected like yin and yang &mdash; picking an
    event handling object selects a code path for program state updates and
    affects the geometries output by
    <code>draw()</code>. The updated arrangement of these geometries, in turn,
    dictates the behavior of <code>pick(event.xy)</code> in the next iteration.
  </p>

  <h2>Closed Curves</h2>
  <p>
    At the core of 2D vector graphics is the mathematical concept of
    <em>"the interior of closed curves"</em>, e.g. circles and rectangles. We've
    all learned how to fill the interior of a rectangle with a nested loop:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
fn draw(rect):
  for y in rect.y1...rect.y2:
    for x in rect.x1...rect.x2:
      rect.color(x, y)
</pre
    >
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This idea can be generalized to all closed curves. The only difference is
    that the horizontal scan line at each \(y\) could potentially enter and
    leave the interior of the curve multiple times, resulting in multiple
    intervals to be filled:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
fn draw(curve):
  for y in curve.y1...curve.y2:
    for x1, x2 in curve.intervals(y):
      for x in x1...x2:
        curve.color(x, y)
</pre
    >
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    By the same logic, if a point at integer coordinates \((x,y)\) lies in the
    interior of a curve, \(x\) must be in the middle of one of
    <code>curve.intervals(y)</code>, so there must be an odd number of
    intersections on either side in the \(x\) direction &mdash; this is all we
    need for <code>pick(event.xy)</code>!
  </p>
  <p>
    This hit-detection method is known as the
    <em>"even-odd rule"</em>. Alternatively, we could also apply the
    <em>"non-zero winding rule"</em>, which I will not get into here.
  </p>

  <h2>Polygons</h2>

  <p>
    Now how do we find <code>curve.intervals(y)</code> for an arbitrary
    (parameterized) closed curve? To answer this question, let's first look at a
    simple case: polygons. For polygons, our problem becomes much more
    tractable: We just need to find all <em>line segments</em> intersecting the
    scan line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given a line segment between \((x_1,y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), where \(y_1 <
    y_2\), we know a scan line at \(y\) can only cross the line segment if \(y_1
    \leq y < y_2\), in which case $$k=\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1}, \quad
    intersection=\left(x_1 + k(y-y_1), y\right).$$
  </p>
  <p>Here is the complete scan-line rasterization algorithm:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <em
      >Keep track of the set of edges intersecting the scan line, along with
      their respective intersection points. In each iteration:
      <ol>
        <li>Traverse each interval at current \(y\) and color each pixel.</li>
        <li>Increment \(y\), then:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Discard edges that no longer intersect the scan line.</li>
          <li>Increment each intersection point \(p\) by \((k_p, 1)\).</li>
          <li>Add new edges that begin to intersect the scan line.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </em>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>This canvas implements the rasterization algorithm described above.</p>

    </div>
    <canvas id="polygon"></canvas>
    <script type="module" src="./demo/polygon.js"></script>
  </div>

  <h2>Transformations</h2>
  <p>
    To move and morph our polygons, we need to apply linear transformations.
    Since a polygon is defined by its vertices, we just need to transform each
    vertex before rasterization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Strictly speaking, the transformations are only linear if we use homogeneous
    coordinates \((wx, wy, w) \in \mathbb{RP}^2\) in the projective space to
    represent a point \((x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) in Euclidean space. The
    advantage of using this framework is that 2D translation, rotation and
    scaling are all represented as composable \(3\times3\) matrices: $$T_{x,y} =
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & x \\ 0 & 1 & y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix},\
    R_{\theta} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\ \sin\theta &
    \cos\theta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix},\ S_{c} = \begin{pmatrix} c & 0 &
    0 \\ 0 & c & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$ This is how CSS
    <code>transform</code> works under the hood.
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>Drag the square to see composed transformations in action!</p>
    </div>
    <canvas id="transform"></canvas>
    <script type="module" src="./demo/transform.js"></script>
  </div>

  <h2>Discretization</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we've handled the case of polygons, there is an obvious solution to
    finding <code>curve.intervals(y)</code>: We can convert any curve into a
    polygon by discrete sampling! Increasing sampling rate would give us better
    results, and eventually a polygon would be indistinguishable from a smooth
    curve when line segments become subpixel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's take elliptic arcs as a non-trivial example. Suppose we want to draw
    an arc from angle \(\phi_1\) to \(\phi_2\) on a ellipse with semi-major axis
    \(a\) and semi-minor axis \(b\), centered at \((x,y)\) and rotated by an
    angle \(\theta\). We can sample \(N + 1\) points: $$\Delta\phi =
    \frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{N}, \quad \begin{pmatrix}x_i\\y_i\end{pmatrix} =
    T_{x,y} R_{\theta} \begin{pmatrix}a\cos\left(\phi_1 + i\Delta\phi\right)\\
    b\sin\left(\phi_1 + i\Delta\phi\right)\end{pmatrix}$$
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>
        You can smooth out this curve by increasing the sampling rate \(N\)!
      </p>
    </div>
    <canvas id="ellipse"></canvas>

    <input id="ellipse-n" type="number" value="8" min="3" />

    <input id="ellipse-phi-2" type="number" value="345" />
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="./demo/ellipse.js"></script>

  <h2>Stroking</h2>
  <p>
    Ellipses are not just interesting in their own right &mdash; thick curves,
    which are conceptually 1D but in fact 2D for practical purposes, could be
    rendered by drawing a sequence of skinny rectangles joined by circles, which
    are, of course, a special case of ellipses!
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>Try writing with your mouse/trackpad on this canvas.</p>
      <p>Can you spot the circles and rectangles?</p>
    </div>
    <canvas id="curve"></canvas>

    <label>line width </label>
    <input id="line-width" type="number" min="1" value="4" />
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="demo/curve.js"></script>

  <h2>Color Gradients</h2>

  <p>
    Before we transition to text rendering, let's take a brief detour and take a
    look at color gradients! Suppose we want the color to change from \(C_1\) to
    \(C_2\). All we need to do is to
    <em>"linearly interpolate"</em> &mdash; i.e., to calculate a weighted
    average of &mdash; the two colors at each pixel: $$interpolate(C_1, C_2, t)
    = (1-t) \cdot C_1 + t \cdot C_2,$$ where the parameter \(t\) varies with
    some sort of distance metric across pixels.
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>
        Take a look at these examples: $$t_{radial} = \frac{\sqrt{(x-x_o)^2 +
        (y-y_o)^2}}{r}, \quad t_{linear} = \frac{y - y_{min}}{y_{max} -
        y_{min}}$$
      </p>
    </div>
    <canvas id="gradient"></canvas>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input id="gradient-color-1" type="color" value="#eeeeee" />
    <input id="gradient-color-2" type="color" value="#000000" />
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="./demo/gradient.js"></script>

  <h2>Bézier Curves</h2>
  <p>
    Interestingly, applying linear interpolation recursively on positions based
    on the same \(t\) parameter at every level produces the famous
    <em>"Bézier curves"</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given control points \(p^{(0)}_0, p^{(0)}_1, \dots p^{(0)}_n\), we could
    construct a Bézier curve \(B(t)\) iteratively using the
    <em>De Casteljau's algorithm</em>:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <em>
      In each iteration \(k \in [1, n]\), for each \(i \in [0, n - k]\):
      $$p^{(k)}_i = (1-t) \cdot p^{(k-1)}_i + t \cdot p^{(k-1)}_{i+1}$$ Finally,
      \(B(t) := p^{(n)}_0\)</em
    >
  </blockquote>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>
        Click on this canvas to place the control points for your Bézier curve!
      </p>
    </div>

    <canvas id="animation"></canvas>
    <script type="module" src="./demo/animation.js"></script>
  </div>

  <h2>Fonts</h2>
  <p>
    In case you haven't guessed it by now, every single letter you are reading
    on this page at this moment &mdash; or indeed, any text that uses
    OpenType/TrueType fonts &mdash; is made of nothing but linear (lines
    segments), quadratic and cubic Bézier curves!
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>
        The text on this canvas is rendered using the same JavaScript
        implementation of the scan-line rasterization algorithm as well as the
        discretization trick we discussed earlier.

    <input id="font-size" type="number" step="1" value="40" />
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="./demo/font.js"></script>

  <h2>View Tree</h2>
  <p>Let's put everything together.</p>
  <p>
    A GUI mainly consists of a containment hierarchy of geometries, which are
    best represented as a <em>tree</em>. Visually, containers are placed beneath
    the things they contain, so nodes closer to the root must be drawn first. In
    other words, we should perform a <em>pre-order traversal</em>:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
fn drawView(node):
  for curve in node.curves:
    draw(curve)
  for child in node.children:
    drawView(child)
</pre
    >
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Hit-detection is straightforward if we have recorded the polygons in their
    draw order. We can simply do a linear search
    <em>backwards</em> for the last drawn &mdash; and therefore topmost &mdash;
    polygon containing the cursor position.
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>These buttons are handmade from raw pixels!</p>
      <p>
        You can adjust the border radius to test the hit-detection mechanism.

    <input id="button-radius" type="number" min="0" max="100" />
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="./demo/composition.js"></script>

  <h2>Alpha Blending</h2>
  <p>
    Within a view tree, geometries overlap and obscure each other. If for
    aesthetic reasons we want to see through a layer, we need to blend it with
    the underlying layer. To do so, instead of overwriting each pixel when we
    call
    <code>draw(geometry)</code>, we need to calculate a weighted average of the
    existing color \((r_2,g_2,b_2)\) of each pixel and the new color
    \((r_1,g_1,b_1)\) to be painted over it. The weight for each color is
    determined by its contribution to the <em>alpha</em> channel: $$a = a_1 +
    a_2 (1-a_1)$$ $$(r,g,b) = \frac{a_1}{a}(r_1,g_1,b_1) +
    \frac{a_2(1-a_1)}{a}(r_2,g_2,b_2)$$
  </p>
  <p>This is known as the <em>over operator</em>.</p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>
        Are you able to identify the stacking order of these transparent layers?
      </p>
      <p>You can increase the opacity to verify your answer!</p>
    </div>
    <canvas id="alpha-compositing"></canvas>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label>alpha </label>
    <input id="alpha" type="number" min="0.1" max="1" value="0.2" step="0.1" />
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="./demo/alpha.js"></script>

  <h2>Filtering</h2>
  <p>
    If we want to clearly distinguish transparent layers, we could apply a
    blurring post-processing effect. To do so, we need to
    <em>"convolve"</em> the image with a <em>"kernel"</em> &mdash; that sounds
    rather highbrow, but we are really just calculating a weighted average (yes,
    again!) of the neighborhood surrounding each pixel, using the weights given
    by a function \(G(u,v)\) called the "kernel": $$C = \sum_{u=-k}^{k}
    \sum_{v=-k}^{k}G(u,v)$$ $$Output(x,y) = \frac{1}{C}\sum_{u=-k}^{k}
    \sum_{v=-k}^{k} G(u,v) \cdot Input(x-u, y-v).$$
  </p>
  <p>
    For blurring we usually use (a discrete version of) the 2D Gaussian function
    $$G(x,y) =
    \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}\exp\left(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).$$ The
    result, as you might have guessed, is called
    <em>"Gaussian blur"</em>.
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <div class="prompt">
      <p>Drag the lens across the image to see Gaussian blur in action!</p>

  <h2>Hardware Acceleration</h2>
  <p>
    So far, we have been iterating through a lot of pixels for every single
    frame! One glaring problem (among several others) with this naïve approach
    is that it doesn't scale well with higher screen resolutions. Fortunately,
    for many of the steps above, we can actually process pixels
    <em>in parallel</em> &mdash;
